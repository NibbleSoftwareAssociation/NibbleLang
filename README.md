## Introduction

Nibble is a statically typed compiled programming language designed to get all benefits 
from [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming),
[Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and
[Procedural Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming).

Nibble design has been influenced by C++, Java, Kotlin, Haskell, Rust and Python.

It comes with a predefined library:
* `lang`  
  Contains basic language constructs.
* `io`  
  Handles input and output. 
* `thread`    
  Used to work with multithreading.
* `gui`   
  Used for Graphical User Interface.
* `net`   
  To works with networks and web.
* `util`    
  Contains a lot of algorithms, data structures and other stuff.

Nibble is built using [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/) as frontend and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) as backend.
